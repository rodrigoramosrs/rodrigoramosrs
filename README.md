# 👋 Hello, I'm Rodrigo Ramos

🚀 Passionate about technology since the age of 11, I'm deeply immersed in the world of information security. Here's a summary of my career:

## 👨‍💼 My Journey / Career

Embarking on my career journey, I first donned the apron as a Waiter 🍽️, serving up smiles with every dish. Then, I hit the right notes as a Salesperson for Musical Instruments and Electronics 🎸, orchestrating perfect matches between musicians and their tools.

Switching gears, I became a Support Analyst 🔧, a digital knight providing software support and customer service. I then leveled up to a Support Analyst Prime 🛒, championing support for major retail chains.

Next, I stepped into the shoes of a QA Analyst 🛒, ensuring smooth commercial automation. My journey then led me to become a Senior Developer 💼, crafting software for hospital and clinic management, and medical image diagnosis.

My path took a secure turn as I became a Security Engineer 🔒, safeguarding AppSec, Redteam, and SOC. Currently, I’m rocking it as a Specialist Security Engineer I 🔥 on the Redteam, always ready for the next cybersecurity challenge! 😊
